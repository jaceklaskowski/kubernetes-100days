# Kubernetes in 100 Days

Notes from the 100 days with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) &mdash; a container orchestration platform (for [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) and [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)).

## The Goal

I've long been thinking about what is _my way of learning_ in a more effective way. I found taking notes in public (mainly on [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/@jaceklaskowski)) very effective to keep the learning pace, and wanted to explore other tools.

Due to the following events I have finally been convinced that it's time to spend some time with Kubernetes.

1. [Apache Spark began supporting Kubernetes](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18278) (aka _Spark on Kubernetes_)

1. [Kubernetes in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/kubernetes-in-action) book was published and soon arrived as a printed book

1. [DC/OS announced support for Kubernetes](https://mesosphere.com/blog/kubernetes-dcos/)

1. [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) requires Zookeeper and one or more Kafka brokers (that begs for Docker Compose at the very least)

1. Docker announced support for Kubernetes ([Docker for Mac ](https://blog.docker.com/2018/01/docker-mac-kubernetes/) and [Docker Enterprise Edition](https://blog.docker.com/2018/01/docker-ee-kubernetes/))

1. More and more projects I've been involved in (with Spark and Kafka) required some kind of container orchestration and mentioned Kubernetes

On Jan 30th, 2018 I thought it'd be a very good time to make it happen and started taking notes in Evernote (locally on my laptop) to see where it'd lead me to. I put a daily task with priority 2 in Todoist right then.

On Feb 7th, 2018, after 4 days of exploring Kubernetes (mainly reading articles, the book and toying with minikube), I thought about publishing the notes on GitHub so it is easier to collaborate with others.

_And that's how the story began._
